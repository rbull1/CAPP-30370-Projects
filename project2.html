        <h2>Post College Goals</h2>
        <p>Since I was a child, my dad has used the phrase <i>Carpe Diem</i>. It was not until I got to college
        	that I fully began to grasp the meaning of this Latin saying. After I graduate, I want to play 
        	professional baseball. To achieve this, I must wake up every morning and <b>sieze the day</b>.
        	Between the 6 AM runs and afternoon practices, I use every day to make myself into the player
        	that I need to be to achieve this goal.</p>
        <p>After I am done playing baseball, I have a desire to be an investment banker. This is my first 
        	year of taking Finance classes in Mendoza, and I feel they are preparing me for the real world.
        	The stock market is a hobby of mine, and I would love to have it be part of my profession. I know
        	that I would be a good suit for the long, hard hours because of my background in playing a sport
        	in college.</p>
