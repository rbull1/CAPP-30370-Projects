        <h2>Post College Goals</h2>
        <p>Since I was a child, my dad has used the phrase <i>Carpe Diem</i>. It was not until I got to college
        	that I fully began to grasp the meaning of this Latin saying. After I graduate, I want to play 
        	professional baseball. To achieve this, I must wake up every morning and <b>sieze the day</b>.
        	Between the 6 AM runs and afternoon practices, I use every day to make myself into the player
        	that I need to be to achieve this goal.</p>
        <p>After I am done playing baseball, I have a desire to be an investment banker. This is my first 
        	year of taking Finance classes in Mendoza, and I feel they are preparing me for the real world.
        	The stock market is a hobby of mine, and I would love to have it be part of my profession. I know
        	that I would be well suited for the long, hard hours because of my background in playing a sport
        	in college.</p>

        	    <p>"Go West, young man, go West and grow up with the country" is a quote by American author Horace Greeley concerning America's expansion westward, related to the then-popular concept of Manifest Destiny.

                    Greeley favored westward expansion. He saw the fertile farmland of the west as an ideal place for people willing to work hard for the opportunity to succeed. The phrase came to symbolize the idea that agriculture could solve many of the nation's problems of poverty and unemployment. It is one of the most commonly quoted sayings from the 19th century and may have had some influence on the course of American history.

                    Well, the Notre Dame baseball and softball teams will adopt a modified version of Greeley's quote: "Go South, young man, go South and grow up with the rest of college athletics."

                    The two Irish programs hope the move will lift their respective programs to unprecedented heights...
