				<p>Peter LaFleur is a charismatic underachiever and proprietor of a rundown gym called 
					Average Joe's. The facility's ecclectic clientele of decidedly less-than-average Joes is 
					comprised of: a self-styled pirate; a scrawny nerd who dreams of impressing an unattainable 
					cheerleader; an obsessive aficionado of obscure sports; a dim-witted young man; and a cocky know-it-all 
					who, of course, really knows nothing. Peter's humble gym catches the eye of White Goodman, the 
					power-mullet-sporting, Fu-Manchu-d, egomaniacal owner of Globo Gym, a gleaming monolith of fitness. 
					White intends to take over Average Joe's, and Peter's non-existent bookkeeping is making it all too easy 
					for him. A foreclosing bank has stationed attorney Kate Veatch inside Average Joe's to finalize Globo's 
					takeover of the gym. But Peter's boyish charms win her over and Kate joins his team of social rejects 
					to beat the odds--and their own ineptitude--to try to save Average Joe's. How? A showdown dodgeball 
					competition against Globo Gym</p>

					<p>Vincent Anthony Vaughn was born on March 28, 1970, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA and raised in 
						Lake Forest, Illinois, USA. His parents were Vernon Vaughn, a salesman, and Sharon Vaughn, a real-estate 
						agent and stockbroker. They later divorced in 1991. He also has two older sisters named Victoria Vaughn 
						and Valeri Vaughn. Vince was interested in theater early on and grabbed a spot in a Chevy commercial. 
						Figuring he was set, he packed his bags and headed for Hollywood only to become a struggling actor losing 
						role after role. He managed to hit a few spots on television, but his real goal was to make it to the big screen. He made 
						his first credited role in the film Rudy (1993) where he met his friend Jon Favreau, who was writing a script detailing his life 
						as an out-of-work actor. Vince was written into Swingers (1996) by Jon to play the character of "Trent". He signed on just as a 
						favor to his buddy, not realizing it would be a career changing role. Though not a commercial success, it was a critical success in 
						which Steven Spielberg saw him and cast him in the big budget sequel The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997). This role gave Vince the 
						exposure he needed to become a movie star and, for the first time, choose the roles he wanted to take. A Cool, Dry Place (1998) put 
						him as a loving father, Return to Paradise (1998) cast him as a man having to make a life or death decision to save a friend, and Clay 
						Pigeons (1998) cast him as an interesting serial killer. Since then his roles have been primarily in comedies such as Old School (2003), 
						Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004), Wedding Crashers (2005), and Couples Retreat (2009).</p>

						Barrymore's cousin, Holly Sullivan, in the 1998 comedy The Wedding Singer.Later TV appearances include a guest star in 2005 in two
						episodes of the cult favorite Arrested Development as "Sally Sitwell" and in 2006 in an episode of NBC's My Name Is Earl. In 
						July 2006, husband Ben Stiller announced plans to direct a CBS comedy series starring Taylor, but the series never aired.She has 
						co-starred with Mandy Moore in both Dedication and License To Wed.Taylor has since appeared opposite Stiller in three 
						films: Zoolander (2001), Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004), and Tropic Thunder (2008).In 2010, Taylor guest starred on Hannah 
						Montana Forever.In 2013, Taylor reprised her role as "Sally Sitwell" in two episodes of the revived Arrested Development.</p>
				<h3>Ben Stiller</h3>

				<p>Ben Stiller was born on November 30, 1965, in New York, New York to legendary comedians Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara. It's not surprising 
					that Ben Stiller has followed in his family's footsteps. Ben's parents made no real effort to keep their son away from the Hollywood 
					lifestyle and he grew up among the stars, wondering just why his parents were so popular. At a young age, he and his sister Amy Stiller 
					would perform plays at home, wearing Amy's tights to perform Shakespeare. Ben also picked up an interest in being on the other side of the 
					camera and, at age 10, began shooting films on his Super 8 camera. The plots were always simple: someone would pick on the shy, awkward 
					Stiller...and then he would always get his revenge. This desire for revenge on the popular, good-looking people may have motivated his 
					teen-angst opus Reality Bites (1994) later in his career. He both directed and performed in the film, which costarred Winona Ryder and 
					Ethan Hawke.Before he even got his start in Hollywood, Ben put in several consistently solid years in the theater. After dropping out of 
					UCLA, he performed in the Tony Award winner, "The House of Blue Leaves". While working on the play, Stiller shot a short spoof of The Color 
					of Money (1986) starring him (in the Tom Cruise role) and his "American Playhouse: The House of Blue Leaves (#6.8)" (1987) costar 
					John Mahoney (in the Paul Newman role). The short film was so funny that Lorne Michaels purchased it and aired it 
					on "Saturday Night Live" (1975). This led to Ben spending a year on the show in 1989.Ben made his big screen debut in Steven Spielberg's 
					Empire of the Sun (1987) in 1987. Demonstrating early on the multifaceted tone his career would take, he soon stepped behind the camera to 
					direct Back to Brooklyn for MTV. The network was impressed and gave Stiller his own show, "The Ben Stiller Show" (1992). He recruited fellow 
					offbeat comedians Janeane Garofalo and Andy Dick and created a bitingly satirical show. MTV ended up passing on it, but it was picked up by 
					Fox. Unfortunately, the show was a ratings miss. Stiller was soon out of work, although he did have the satisfaction of picking up an Emmy 
					for the show after its cancellation.For a while, Ben had to settle for guest appearance work. While he was doing this, he saved up his cash 
					and in the end was able to scrape enough together to make Reality Bites (1994), now a cult classic which is looked upon favorably by the 
					generation it depicted. Ben continued to work steadily for a time, particularly in independent productions where he was more at ease. 
					However, he never quite managed to catch a big break. His first big budget directing job was Jim Carrey's The Cable Guy (1996). Although 
					many critics were impressed, Jim Carrey's fans were not.In 1998, There's Something About Mary (1998) had propelled Ben into the mainstream 
					spotlight. With his wince-inducing turn in the Farrelly brothers' gross-out film, Ben really "struck a nerve" with mainstream America. 
					In recent years, Ben has starred in such hit movies as Keeping the Faith (2000) and Meet the Parents (2000). Ben excels at cerebral comedy, 
					but he knows how to get down and lowbrow when he needs to, making him one of America's currently most popular performers.
